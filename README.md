## 🏗 Data Model Architecture

A star schema was implemented for optimized performance and accurate time intelligence.

**Fact Table:**
- `order_items`

**Dimension Tables:**
- `orders`
- `customers`
- `products`
- `date`

Relationships were carefully defined to ensure:
- Accurate revenue aggregation
- Proper filter propagation
- Correct time-based analysis

## 📊 Key DAX Measures

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM('public order_items'[price])

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT('public orders'[order_id])

Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT('public customers'[customer_unique_id])

AOV = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])

MoM Growth % =
VAR PrevMonth =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH))
RETURN
DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - PrevMonth, PrevMonth)

YoY Growth % =
VAR PrevYear =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN
DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - PrevYear, PrevYear)
```

---

## 📌 Business Insights Derived

- Revenue showed steady growth between 2016–2018.
- High dependency on new customers rather than repeat buyers.
- A small number of categories contribute majority of revenue (Pareto effect observed).
- Customer retention improvement could significantly increase lifetime value.
